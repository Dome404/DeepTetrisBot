# Tetris Game

This repository contains the implementation of the Tetris game in two different files: `HumanTetris.py` and `RobotTetris.py`.

## HumanTetris.py

`HumanTetris.py` allows a human player to play Tetris using the arrow keys. Simply run the script and enjoy playing the game!

## RobotTetris.py

`RobotTetris.py` is designed for running a bot to play Tetris. If you have a pretrained model, you can use it to make the bot play. If you want to train a bot from scratch, this file also provides the necessary functionality.

Please note that the documentation and code organization are still a big work in progress. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out. Enjoy playing Tetris!
